## DJANGO

### What is DJANGO?

#### Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.

### Where did DJANGO come from?

#### Django was initially developed between 2003 and 2005 by a web team who were responsible for creating and maintaining newspaper websites. After creating a number of sites, the team began to factor out and reuse lots of common code and design patterns.

### Is DJANGO frontEnd or backEnd?

#### Among the major benefits of using Django for back-end web development is its Representational State Transfer (REST) framework, which is a popular toolkit for building APIs. The power of Django's REST framework can be assessed from the fact that it takes just three lines of code to build a ready-to-use API.

### Which Language is better for DJANGO?

#### Django web development with Python is perhaps the most effective way to create web applications and write code for them.

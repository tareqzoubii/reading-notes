## HASHTABELS

## What is Hashtabels in python?
>A Hash Table in Python is nothing but a data structure where data is stored in an associative manner. In hash tables, data is stored in an array format, with every data value having an exclusive or unique index value. This type of storage offers quick access to data if the index of the data required is available.

## Why is hash used in Python?
> Python hash() function is a built-in function and returns the hash value of an object if it has one. The hash value is an integer which is used to quickly compare dictionary keys while looking at a dictionary.

## What are the 3 main properties of hash function?

> They are “collision-free.” This means that no two input hashes should map to the same output hash.

> They can be hidden. It should be difficult to guess the input value for a hash function from its output.

> They should be puzzle-friendly

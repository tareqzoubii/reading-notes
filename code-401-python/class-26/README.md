## Graphs

## How to create a graph in Python?
>The following steps are involved in plotting a line.

>1:Import matplotlib.

>2:Specify the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the line.

>3:Plot the specified points using specific function using .plot() function.

>4:Name the x-axis and y-axis using .xlabel() and .ylabel() functions.

## What are the types of graphs in Python?

>'bar' or 'barh' for bar plots.

>'hist' for histogram.

>'box' for boxplot.

>'kde' or 'density' for density plots.

>'area' for area plots.

>'scatter' for scatter plots.

>'hexbin' for hexagonal bin plots.

>'pie' for pie plots.

## How are graphs represented in Python?

>Graphs in Python can be represented in several different ways. The most notable ones are adjacency matrices, adjacency lists, and lists of edges. In this guide, we'll cover all of them. When implementing graphs, you can switch between these types of representations at your leisure.
